### Week 8
###### October 23rd, 2018
##### During Class
I Repurchased my parts kit this week as I had misplaced my previous one, I also purchased a 32GB micro SD card. In class I began wiring my AMG8833 sensor to my Raspberry Pi 3, making use of a breadboard. Once I began wiring I soon realized I do not have the special wires to plug into the header pins on the Raspberry Pi and to the breadboard. To get around this I broke off single header pins, plugged them into the breadboard. I then used aligator clips on the individual header pins and on the header pins on the Raspberry Pi to make my connections, using small pieces on paper to prevent shorts on the Pi. I will eventually clean up my wiring but as of right now it does not matter. During class I also copied the required NOOBs files to the root of my 32GB SD card. I was not able to begin setting up the image on my Pi as there was a shortage of display adapters, something out of my hands. Thus, later today I will set up the image at home where I have the proper equipment and make another blog post. During this time I also found a helpful post on instructables which will help me when setting up the image on my Pi, this link is also where I found my wiring diagram. https://www.instructables.com/id/Thermal-Camera-AMG833-Raspberry-Pi/
